# **Custom List Implementations in TypeScript**

## **Overview**
This repository contains two implementations of a `List` class in TypeScript, both of which adhere to a common interface:

1. **Linked List-based List**
2. **Array-based List**

Both classes provide the same functionality and are fully covered with unit tests using Jest.

## **Features**
- Append, insert, and delete elements
- Find first and last occurrences of an element
- Clone and extend lists
- Reverse the order of elements
- Iterable support (`for...of` loop)
- Full unit test coverage

## **Variant**
Group Number = 25 

25 % 4 = 1

| Remainder | Initial implementation | Second implementation  |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1         | Doubly-linked list     | Based on built-in list |


## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses Continuous Integration (CI) to automatically run tests on each commit and pull request. This ensures that new changes do not introduce regressions and that both list implementations remain consistent.

## Conclusion

Writing unit tests for both list implementations proved to be an essential part of the development process. These tests provided several key benefits.
By covering all major functionalities with unit tests, we ensured that both implementations were **robust, maintainable, and reliable**. This demonstrates the importance of unit testing in software development and its role in improving code 
quality.
